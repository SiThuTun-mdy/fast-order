# Fast Order
### One Developer. Five AI Agents. Demo Purpose.

**Stack:** Express · React ·  Playwright
**Built:** VibeCode Tour · Jul 2026

## The Problem & The Pipeline

Small food stall and food house can easily use to accept order.
Easy to order and check order status on real time.

| BEFORE: Fragmented | AFTER: SpecFlow Lite |
|---|---|
| ✏️ Google Docs (Requirements) | 📋 Requirements |
| 📝 Notion (Specs) | ↕️ |
| 🎫 Jira (Tasks) | 📐 Specifications ← GitHub Spec Kit |
| ❌ No traceability | ↕️ |
| ❌ Context switching | ✅ Tasks |
| ❌ Setup overhead | **All linked. All traceable.** |

**Pipeline:** `ANALYZE → CLARIFY → SPECIFY → PLAN → TASKS → IMPLEMENT → REVIEW`

📊 7 features · 42 spec docs · 100 tests

## Multi-Agent Architecture

| Agent | Tools | Deliverables |
|---|---|---|
| 🧠 BA | Seq Thinking | User stories, ACs, edge cases |
| 🏗️ Architect | Seq Thinking, Context7, Supabase | DB schema, API routes, data flow |
| 💻 Developer | Context7, GitHub, Playwright | 41 components, 100 tests, 10 APIs |
| 🧪 QA | Playwright | E2E tests, console checks, responsive validation |
| 👀 Reviewer | GitHub | Code quality, risk assessment, PR gate |
| 🔒 Security | Context7, Supabase | RLS audit, auth review, OWASP scan |

> **Rule:** No implementation without approved spec. Dev escalates → Reviewer + Security.

## 18 Skills — Composable & Versioned

| Phase | Skill | Output |
|---|---|---|
| **Analysis** | `ba-skill`, `speckit-analyze`, `speckit-clarify` | User stories, ACs, ambiguity resolved |
| **Design** | `architect`, `ux-skill`, `speckit-plan` | DB schema, API design, impl plan |
| **Build** | `speckit-implement`, `speckit-tasks` | Components, task deps, estimates |
| **Test/Review** | `qa-skill`, `reviewer`, `security-review` | E2E tests, code review, RLS audit |
| **Knowledge** | `swarmvault`, `speckit-constitution` | Code graph, wiki, conventions |

```
Skills aren't prompts — they're engineering knowledge you compose, version, and reuse.
The same skill produces the same quality bar across 7 feature cycles.
Different agents, different features, consistent output.

## 8 MCP Tools — Augmented Context

| Tool | Function |
|---|---|
| 📚 **Context7** | Live docs for Next.js, Supabase, Zod |
| 🔧 **GitHub** | Issues, PRs, Copilot review |
| 🧪 **Playwright** | Browser automation, 100 E2E tests |
| 🎨 **Magic UI** | Component inspiration, dashboards |
| 🧠 **Seq Thinking** | Structured reasoning, architecture |
| 🗺️ **SwarmVault** | Code graph, wiki, blast radius |
| 💾 **Claude Mem** | Cross-session project memory |
| 🛢️ **Supabase** | RLS, migrations, query inspection |

```
Agent calls MCP → MCP provides live context → Agent makes informed decision
No more hallucinated APIs. No more guessing library signatures.
~80% fewer broad file searches via graph-first queries.
```
